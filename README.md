- Current Animals in Shelter: ~24,888

**Outcome Distribution**
- Rescue: 12,233 (23.4%)
- Adoption: 11,172 (21.3%)
- Euthanasia: 9,600 (18.3%)
- Died: 1,257 (2.4%)
➡️ A strong live release rate indicates effective rescue and adoption efforts, though euthanasia remains a significant area for improvement.

**3. Animal Intake Analysis**
- Most Intake Animal Types
- Cats: 54.76%
- Dogs: 36.98%
- Birds: 8.25%
- ➡️ Cats dominate intake volume, indicating a need for targeted cat adoption and sterilization programs.

- Wildlife: 8,150
- Owner Surrender: 4,599
- Welfare Seized: 938
- ➡️ Stray animals are the primary contributor, highlighting urban animal control challenges.

**4. Monthly & Weekly Trends**
Intake by Month
- Highest intakes observed between April to July
- Peak months align with breeding seasons and increased stray populations
**Intake by Day of Week**
- Wednesday and Thursday show the highest intake volumes
- Monday and Tuesday show comparatively lower activity
- ➡️ Staffing and resources should be optimized mid-week for operational efficiency.

**5. Animal Health & Condition at Intake**
Top Intake Conditions
- Normal: 23,528
- Under Age/Weight: 11,935
- Injured (Severe/Moderate/Mild): ~7,600+
- Ill (Mild/Moderate/Severe): ~6,300+
- ➡️ A significant number of animals require medical attention, impacting shelter costs and length of stay.

**6. Outcome & Survival Analysis**
- Outcome Alive Status
- Alive: 41,486
- Not Alive: 10,857

**Animal Outcome by Sex (Alive %)**
- Spayed: 97.70%
- Neutered: 95.47%
- Female: 79.88%
- Male: 78.37%
- Unknown: 49.03%
- ➡️ Sterilized animals have the highest survival and adoption success rates, proving the importance of spay/neuter programs.

**7. Time-Based Performance**
- Intake Duration vs Outcome
- Animals staying longer are more likely to be adopted
- Short stays often correlate with non-live outcomes
- ➡️ Reducing length of stay while maintaining care quality can improve adoption outcomes.

**8. Key Insights & Recommendations**
Insights
- Cats require focused adoption strategies
- Mid-week intake peaks need better staffing
- Medical cases significantly impact shelter operations
- Spay/neuter programs drastically improve survival
